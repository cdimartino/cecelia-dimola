      <p>If anyone feels the desire to send something, our family would appreciate donations be made In Honor of
        <em>Cecelia
          Mary DiMola</em> through either of the following foundations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://give.michaeljfox.org/give/489726#!/donation/checkout" target="blank">
            🕊️ Michael J. Fox Foundation 🐺
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://www.apdaparkinson.org/1907d3l/" target="_blank">
            🇺🇸 American Parkinson Disease Association 👩‍⚕️
          </a>
        </li>
      </ul>

      <p>Most companies will match your donation, and the donation page can help you find out if your employer is one of
        them. Give what you feel you can. We need to find a way to eradicate this terrible neurological disease from the
        planet. It is affecting more and more people each year, and its impact is relentless and devastating. We didn’t
        find a cure before Mom had to leave, but a cure is going to be found soon.</p>
